ChatGPT 3.5 estimates speech recognition & NLP tech value as trillions of dollars.
I think I could try to achieve something in this direction.
Going to study the free Yandex textbook on neural nets.
And of course I will employ the complexified graphs structure of texts & systems.
And unlike the Ben Goertzel's probabilistic approach to PLN, I will employ complexified & any type values for formulas, not just a real number probability.
I call this metamorphic logic or multimodal logic.

Let's attempt to do a trillion. If I get the money, of course.

And I am a fan of true NLU (understanding), where the results can be proven, verified, explained, sound.

So I could try to employ also logic systems by Douglas Miles et al https://logicmoo.org/ https://github.com/logicmoo to verify stuff and maybe more.
